Using callbacks to read value from a node and write to next node.
These writes fail (in the sense that the next node is not set accordingly):
    -node.names['Close.c-body.secure channel id'] = sec_channel_id
    -node.stack[1].stack[0]._value = sec_channel_id
although the following prints gave me the right value of the field taken from the prev node:
    print_dbg("sec ch from node names " + str(node.names['Close.c-body.secure channel id']))
    print_dbg("sec ch from session " + str(session.nodes[3].names['Close.c-body.secure channel id']))

This write works
    -node.stack[1].stack[0]._default_value = sec_channel_id

How to find:
    -print("all values of -sec ch id- " + str(pprint(vars(node.stack[1].stack[0]))))
        printing all variables of this field, I found that the default_value is the only one used in next node transmission
